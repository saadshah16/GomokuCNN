AI Gomoku: Strategic Play with Convolutional Neural Networks
Benchmarking CNN's performance with Minimax Algorithm for 15x15 Gomoku Board Game
Project Overview
This project presents an artificial intelligence (AI) designed to master the game of Gomoku. Using advanced deep learning techniques, we have constructed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that not only learns the intricacies of the game but also develops innovative strategies to compete at high levels of play. This project encapsulates the culmination of research, experimentation, and implementation, providing a window into the future of AI in strategic game theory.

Comprehensive Methodology
Utilizing the power of CNNs, our model digests the vast state space of the Gomoku board, applying layers of computational neurons to distill complex patterns and strategies from raw data. The model's architecture is engineered to balance computational efficiency with predictive power, resulting in an AI that can adapt to and counter human-like strategic play.

Detailed Architecture
Our CNN model is composed of:

Five input layers to encapsulate various game states.
A 7x7 filter size to capture the breadth of the game board.
ReLU activation functions to introduce non-linearity and enable complex pattern recognition.
A Sigmoid output layer to deliver a probabilistic interpretation of the AI's move choices.
